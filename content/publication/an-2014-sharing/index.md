abstract: 'One might think that, compared to traditional media, social media sites
  allow people to choose more freely what to read and what to share, especially for
  politically oriented news. However, reading and sharing habits originate from deeply
  ingrained behaviors that might be hard to change. To test the extent to which this
  is true, we propose a Political News Sharing (PoNS) model that holistically captures
  four key aspects of social psychology: gratification, selective exposure, socialization,
  and trust & intimacy. Using real instances of political news sharing in Twitter,
  we study the predictive power of these features. As one might expect, news sharing
  heavily depends on what one likes and agrees with (selective exposure). Interestingly,
  it also depends on the credibility of a news source, i.e., whether the source is
  a social media friend or a news outlet (trust & intimacy) as well as on the informativeness
  or the enjoyment of the news article (gratification). Finally, a Twitter user tends
  to share articles matching his own political leaning but, at times, the user also
  shares politically opposing articles, if those match the leaning of his followers
  (socialization). Based on our PoNS model, we build a prototype of a news sharing
  application that promotes serendipitous political readings along our four dimensions.'
