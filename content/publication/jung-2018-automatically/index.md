abstract: Social media analytics is insightful but can also be difficult to use within
  organizations. To address this, we present Automatic Persona Generation (APG), a
  system and methodology for quantitatively generating personas using large amounts
  of online social media data. The APG system is operational, deployed in a pilot
  version with several organizations in multiple industry verticals. APG uses a robust
  web and stable back-end database framework to process tens of millions of user interactions
  with thousands of online digital products on multiple social media platforms, including
  Facebook and YouTube. APG identifies both distinct and impactful audience segments
  for an organization to create persona profiles by enhancing the social media analytics
  data with pertinent features, such as names, photos, interests, etc. We demonstrate
  the architecture development, and main system features. APG provides value for organizations
  distributing content via online platforms and is unique in its approach to leveraging
  social media data for audience understanding. APG is online at https://persona.qcri.org.
