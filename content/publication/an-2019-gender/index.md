abstract: Gender and racial diversity in the mediated images from the media shape
  our perception of different demographic groups. In this work, we investigate gender
  and racial diversity of 85,957 advertising images shared by the 73 top international
  brands on Instagram and Facebook. We hope that our analyses give guidelines on how
  to build a fully automated watchdog for gender and racial diversity in online advertisements.
