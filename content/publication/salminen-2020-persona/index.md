abstract: Although used in many domains, the evaluation of personas is difficult due
  to the lack of validated measurement instruments. To tackle this challenge, we propose
  the Persona Perception Scale (PPS), a survey instrument for evaluating how individuals
  perceive personas. We develop the scale by reviewing relevant literature from social
  psychology, persona studies, and Human-Computer Interaction to find relevant constructs
  and items for measuring persona perceptions. Following initial pilot testing, we
  conduct an exploratory validation of the scale with 412 respondents and find that
  the constructs and items of the scale perform satisfactorily for deployment. The
  research has implications for both academic researchers and persona developers.
  Using the PPS, researchers and designers can evaluate how different persona designs
  affect individual perceptions of personas, for example persona users’ (e.g., designers,
  marketers, software developers) perceived credibility of the persona and their willingness
  to use it. Because persona perceptions are associated with persona acceptance and
  adoption, using a perceptual measurement instrument can improve the chances of persona
  adoption and use in real organizations.
