abstract: It is known that news topics, covered more frequently and over longer periods
  of time, are considered to be important to the public. Hence, what gets media attention
  and how media attention evolves over time has been studied for decades in communication
  study. However, previous studies are confined to a few countries or a few topics,
  mainly due to lack of longitudinal global data. In this work, we use a large-scale
  news data compiled from 196 countries to provide empirical analyses of media attention
  dynamics.
