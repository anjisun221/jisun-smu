 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a social relation aware routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks, which is designed for content sharing mobile social applications. Since a content can be shared by a group of users who have similar interests, the similarity of users' interests is a good metric to predict who will consume which contents. Shared interests can be exploited in routing and replication of content request and reply to achieve enhanced efficacy in content sharing. Since routing determines which content will be forwarded by whom, a route selected based on similarity of interest increases the utilization of contents replication in intermediate nodes. This paper describes the design and implementation of a social relation aware routing protocol that uses social relation as a part of routing metric. Simulation results shows that the proposed routing protocol improves higher delivery ratio with lower network overhead than DSDV.},
