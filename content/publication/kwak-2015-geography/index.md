abstract: In this work, we reveal the structure of global news coverage of disasters
  and its determinants by using a large-scale news coverage dataset collected by the
  GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone) project that monitors news media
  in over 100 languages from the whole world. Significant variables in our hierarchical
  (mixed-effect) regression model, such as the number of population, the political
  stability, the damage, and more, are well aligned with a series of previous research.
  Yet, strong regionalism we found in news geography highlights the necessity of the
  comprehensive dataset for the study of global news coverage.
