 abstract = {We built a multiplex media attention and disregard network (MADN) among 129 countries over 212 days. By characterizing the MADN from multiple levels, we found that it is formed primarily by skewed, hierarchical, and asymmetric relationships. Also, we found strong evidence that our news world is becoming a "global village." However, at the same time, unique attention blocks of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as well as Russia and its neighbors, still exist.},
