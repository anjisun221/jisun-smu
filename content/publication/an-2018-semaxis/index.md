abstract: Because word semantics can substantially change across communities and contexts,
  capturing domain-specific word semantics is an important challenge. Here, we propose
  SemAxis, a simple yet powerful framework to characterize word semantics using many
  semantic axes in word-vector spaces beyond sentiment. We demonstrate that SemAxis
  can capture nuanced semantic representations in multiple online communities. We
  also show that, when the sentiment axis is examined, SemAxis outperforms the state-of-the-art
  approaches in building domain-specific sentiment lexicons.
