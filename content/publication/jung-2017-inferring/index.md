abstract: In this research, we evaluate the applicability of using facial recognition
  of social media account profile pictures to infer the demographic attributes of
  gender, race, and age of the account owners leveraging a commercial and well-known
  image service, specifically Face++. Our goal is to determine the feasibility of
  this approach for actual system implementation. Using a dataset of approximately
  10,000 Twitter profile pictures, we use Face++ to classify this set of images for
  gender, race, and age. We determine that about 30% of these profile pictures contain
  identifiable images of people using the current state-of-the-art automated means.
  We then employ human evaluations to manually tag both the set of images that were
  determined to contain faces and the set that was determined not to contain faces,
  comparing the results to Face++. Of the thirty percent that Face++ identified as
  containing a face, about 80% are more likely than not the account holder based on
  our manual classification, with a variety of issues in the remaining 20%. Of the
  images that Face++ was unable to detect a face, we isolate a variety of likely issues
  preventing this detection, when a face actually appeared in the image. Overall,
  we find the applicability of automatic facial recognition to infer demographics
  for system development to be problematic, despite the reported high accuracy achieved
  for image test collections
