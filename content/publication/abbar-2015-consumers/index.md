abstract: In the last decades researchers have devoted a fair amount of effort to
  understand the news geography, i.e. a description of the general patterns for which
  countries are presented in which other countries’ news. These efforts presume that
  published opinion is a good enough proxy to infer such perception; indeed, that
  is the case when no other evidence is available. In this work we uncover a new point
  of view, that of consumers, relying on a rich data set related to the comments posted
  by users on the largest news media organization in the Middle East region, namely
  Aljazeera Network. Each comment comes with a body content, a unique identifier of
  the user, and her IP address, which makes it possible to infer the countries from
  which comments are posted. All in all, our analysis encompasses over 20,000 articles
  and more than 2 million comments posted by 90,000 unique readers. Such a rich data
  set allows us confronting for the first time –to the best of our knowledge– the
  producer-consumer standpoints.
