abstract: We conduct a mixed-method study to better understand the content consumption
  patterns of Middle Eastern social media users and to explore new ways to present
  online data by using automatic persona generation. First, we analyze millions of
  content interactions on YouTube to dynamically generate personas describing behavioral
  patterns of different demographic groups. Second, we analyze interview data on social
  media users in the Middle Eastern region to generate additional insights into the
  dynamically generated personas. Our findings provide insights into social media
  users in the Middle East, as well as present a novel methodology of using computational
  analysis and qualitative data enrichment to generate descriptive and culturally
  receptive personas from social media audiences.
