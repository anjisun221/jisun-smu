abstract: In this research, we conceptually examine the use of personas in an age
  of large-scale online analytics data. Based on the criticism and benefits outlined
  in prior work and by practitioners working with online data, we formulate the major
  arguments for and against the use of personas given real-time online analytics data
  about customers, analyze these arguments, and demonstrate areas for the productive
  employment of data-driven personas by leveraging online analytics data in their
  creation. Our key tenet is that data-driven personas are located between aggregated
  and individual customer statistics. At their best, digital data-driven personas
  capture the coverage of the customer base attributed to aggregated data representations
  while retaining the interpretability of individual-level analytics; they benefit
  from powerful computational techniques and novel data sources. We discuss how digital
  data-driven personas can draw from technological advancements to remedy the notable
  concerns voiced by scholars and practitioners, including persona validation, inconsistency
  problem, and long development times. Finally, we outline areas of future research
  of personas in the context of online analytics. We argue that to survive in the
  rapidly developing online customer analytics industry, personas must evolve by adopting
  new practices.
