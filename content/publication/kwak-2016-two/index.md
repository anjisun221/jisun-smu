abstract: In this work, we compare GDELT and Event Registry, which monitor news articles
  worldwide and provide big data to researchers regarding scale, news sources, and
  news geography.  We found significant differences in scale and news sources, but
  surprisingly, we observed high similarity in news geography between the two datasets.
