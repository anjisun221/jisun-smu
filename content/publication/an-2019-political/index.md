abstract: 'Online platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, provide users
  with a rich set of features for sharing and consuming political information, expressing
  political opinions, and exchanging potentially contrary political views. In such
  activities, two types of communication spaces naturally emerge: those dominated
  by exchanges between politically homogeneous users and those that allow and encourage
  crosscutting exchanges in politically heterogeneous groups. While research on political
  talk in online environments abounds, we know surprisingly little about the potentially
  varying nature of discussions in politically homogeneous spaces as compared to cross-cutting
  communication spaces. To fill this gap, we use Reddit to explore the nature of political
  discussions in homogeneous and cross-cutting communication spaces. In particular,
  we develop an analytical template to study interaction and linguistic patterns within
  and between politically homogeneous and heterogeneous communication spaces. Our
  analyses reveal different behavioral patterns in homogeneous and cross-cutting communications
  spaces. We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of research
  on political talk online.'
