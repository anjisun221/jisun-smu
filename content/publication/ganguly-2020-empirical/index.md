abstract: In this work, we empirically validate three common assumptions in building
  political media bias datasets, which are (i) labelers’ political leanings do not
  affect labeling tasks, (ii) news articles follow their source outlet’s political
  leaning, and (iii) political leaning of a news outlet is stable across different
  topics. We build a ground-truth dataset of manually annotated article-level political
  leaning and validate the three assumptions. Our findings warn that the three assumptions
  could be invalid even for a small dataset. We hope that our work calls attention
  to the (in)validity of common assumptions in building political media bias datasets.
