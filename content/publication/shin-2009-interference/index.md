abstract: Utilization of multiple radio interfaces increases throughput of wireless
  networks. Existing work proposes a multi-radio routing protocol exploiting link
  quality and channel diversity of a path. While an established path is deteriorated
  by interferences incurred by any changes in a network, and existing work does not
  detect the deterioration. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware multi-radio
  routing protocol detecting and resolving dynamic path deterioration in wireless
  mesh networks.
