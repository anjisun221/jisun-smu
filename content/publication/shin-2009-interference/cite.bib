 abstract = {Utilization of multiple radio interfaces increases throughput of wireless networks. Existing work proposes a multi-radio routing protocol exploiting link quality and channel diversity of a path. While an established path is deteriorated by interferences incurred by any changes in a network, and existing work does not detect the deterioration. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware multi-radio routing protocol detecting and resolving dynamic path deterioration in wireless mesh networks.},
