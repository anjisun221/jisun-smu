abstract: "Lack of diversity in advertising is a long-standing problem. Despite growing\
  \ cultural awareness and missed business opportunities, many minorities remain under-\
  \ or inappropriately represented in advertising. Previous research has studied how\
  \ people react to culturally embedded ads, but such work focused mostly on print\
  \ media or television using lab experiments. In this work, we look at diversity\
  \ in content posted by 69 U.S. brands on two social media platforms, Instagram and\
  \ Facebook. Using face detection technology, we infer the gender, race, and age\
  \ of both the faces in the ads and of the users engaging with ads. Using this dataset,\
  \ we investigate the following: (1) What type of content brands put out -- Is there\
  \ a lack of diversity?; (2) How does a brand's content diversity compare to its\
  \ audience diversity -- Is any lack of diversity simply a reflection of the audience?;\
  \ and (3) How does brand diversity relate to user engagement -- Do users of a particular\
  \ demographic engage more if their demographics are represented in a post?"
