 abstract = {User engagement on social networks is essential for news outlets where they often distribute online content. News outlets simultaneously leverage multiple social media platforms to reach their overall audience and to increase marketshare. In this research, we analyze ten common stylistic features indicative of user engagement for news postings on multiple social media platforms. We display the stylistic features usage differences of news posts from various news sources. Results show that there are differences in the usage of stylistic features across social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube). Online news outlets can benefit from these findings in building guidelines for content editors and creators to create more users engaging postings.},
