abstract: User engagement on social networks is essential for news outlets where they
  often distribute online content. News outlets simultaneously leverage multiple social
  media platforms to reach their overall audience and to increase marketshare. In
  this research, we analyze ten common stylistic features indicative of user engagement
  for news postings on multiple social media platforms. We display the stylistic features
  usage differences of news posts from various news sources. Results show that there
  are differences in the usage of stylistic features across social media platforms
  (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube). Online news outlets can benefit from
  these findings in building guidelines for content editors and creators to create
  more users engaging postings.
