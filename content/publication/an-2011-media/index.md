abstract: We present a preliminary but groundbreaking study of the media landscape
  of Twitter. We use public data on whom follows who to uncover common behaviour in
  media consumption, the relationship between various classes of media, and the diversity
  of media content which social links may bring. Our analysis shows that there is
  a non-negligible amount of indirect media exposure, either through friends who follow
  particular media sources, or via retweeted messages. We show that the indirect media
  exposure expands the political diversity of news to which users are exposed to a
  surprising extent, increasing the range by between 60-98%. These results are valuable
  because they have not been readily available to traditional media, and they can
  help predict how we will read news, and how publishers will interact with us in
  the future.
