abstract: Understanding users in the era of social media is challenging, requiring
  organizations to adopt novel computation-aided approaches. To exemplify such an
  approach, we retrieved information on millions of interactions with YouTube video
  content from a major Middle Eastern media outlet, to automatically generate personas
  that capture how different audience segments interact with thousands of individual
  content pieces. Then, we used qualitative data to provide additional insights into
  the automatically generated persona profiles. Our findings provide insights into
  social media usage in the Middle East and demonstrate the application of a novel
  methodology that generates culturally adapted personas of social media audiences,
  summarizing complex social analytics data into human portrayals that are easy to
  understand by end users in real organizations.
