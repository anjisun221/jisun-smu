abstract: In this work, we describe a methodology for leveraging large amounts of
  customer interaction data with online content from major social media platforms
  in order to isolate meaningful customer segments. The methodology is robust in that
  it can rapidly identify diverse customer segments using solely online behaviors
  and then associate these behavioral customer segments with the related distinct
  demographic segments, presenting a holistic picture of the customer base of an organization.
  We validate our methodology via the implementation of a working system that rapidly
  and in near real-time processes tens of millions of online customer interactions
  with content posted on major social media platforms in order to identify both the
  distinct behavioral segments and corresponding impactful demographic segments. We
  illustrate the functionality of the methodology with real data from a major online
  content provider with millions of online interactions from more than thirty countries.
  We further show one possible use for such information via the automatic generation
  of personas for an organization, which can be used for the formulation of marketing
  strategy, implementation of advertising plans, or development of products. The research
  results offer insights into competitive marketing and product preferences for the
  consumers of online digital content. We conclude with a discussion of areas for
  future work.
