abstract: We propose FrameAxis, a method of characterizing the framing of a given
  text by identifying the most relevant semantic axes (\"microframes\") defined by
  antonym word pairs. In contrast to the traditional framing analysis, which has been
  constrained by a small number of manually annotated general frames, our unsupervised
  approach provides much more detailed insights, by considering a host of semantic
  axes. Our method is capable of quantitatively teasing out framing bias -- how biased
  a text is in each microframe -- and framing intensity -- how much each microframe
  is used -- from the text, offering a nuanced characterization of framing. We evaluate
  our approach using SemEval datasets as well as three other datasets and human evaluations,
  demonstrating that FrameAxis can reliably characterize documents with relevant microframes.
  Our method may allow scalable and nuanced computational analyses of framing across
  disciplines.
