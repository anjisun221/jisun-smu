 abstract = {We propose FrameAxis, a method of characterizing the framing of a given text by identifying the most relevant semantic axes ("microframes") defined by antonym word pairs. In contrast to the traditional framing analysis, which has been constrained by a small number of manually annotated general frames, our unsupervised approach provides much more detailed insights, by considering a host of semantic axes. Our method is capable of quantitatively teasing out framing bias -- how biased a text is in each microframe -- and framing intensity -- how much each microframe is used -- from the text, offering a nuanced characterization of framing. We evaluate our approach using SemEval datasets as well as three other datasets and human evaluations, demonstrating that FrameAxis can reliably characterize documents with relevant microframes. Our method may allow scalable and nuanced computational analyses of framing across disciplines.},
