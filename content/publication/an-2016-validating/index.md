abstract: Using personas during interactive design has considerable potential for
  product and content development. Unfortunately, personas have typically been a fairly
  static technique. In this research, we validate an approach for creating personas
  in real time, based on analysis of actual social media data in an effort to automate
  the generation of personas. We validate that social media data can be implemented
  as an approach for automating generating personas in real time using actual YouTube
  social media data from a global media corporation that produces online digital content.
  Using the organization's YouTube channel, we collect demographic data, customer
  interactions, and topical interests, leveraging more than 188,000 subscriber profiles
  and more than 30 million user interactions. Then, we conduct statistical analysis
  on the social media data to determine whether the data could lead to the generation
  of valid personas based on statistically difference market segments. Findings show
  that customers can be segmented using product topics by gender and age based using
  social media data. However, our findings also show that the data is biased by the
  content created. The results offer insights into competitive marketing and product
  preferences for the consumers of the online digital content. Implications are that
  personas can be generated in real-time using social media data, instead of a time-consuming
  manual development process.
