abstract: We propose a novel method for generating personas based on online user data
  for the increasingly common situation of content creators distributing products
  via online platforms. We use non-negative matrix factorization to identify user
  segments and develop personas by adding personality such as names and photos. Our
  approach can develop accurate personas representing real groups of people using
  online user data, versus relying on manually gathered data.
