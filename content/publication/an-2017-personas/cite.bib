 abstract = {We propose a novel method for generating personas based on online user data for the increasingly common situation of content creators distributing products via online platforms. We use non-negative matrix factorization to identify user segments and develop personas by adding personality such as names and photos. Our approach can develop accurate personas representing real groups of people using online user data, versus relying on manually gathered data.},
