abstract: '1One of the reasons for using personas is to align user understandings
  across project teams and sites. As part of a larger persona study, at Al Jazeera
  English (AJE), we conducted 16 qualitative interviews with media producers, the
  end users of persona descriptions. We asked the participants about their understanding
  of a typical AJE media consumer, and the variety of answers shows that the understandings
  are not aligned and are built on a mix of own experiences, own self, assumptions,
  and data given by the company. The answers are sometimes aligned with the data-driven
  personas and sometimes not. The end users are divided in two groups: news producers
  who have little interest in having data-based insights of news consumers and producers
  for social media platforms who have more interest in this information.'
