abstract: 'We develop a methodology to automate creating imaginary people, referred
  to as personas, by processing complex behavioral and demographic data of social
  media audiences. From a popular social media account containing more than 30 million
  interactions by viewers from 198 countries engaging with more than 4,200 online
  videos produced by a global media corporation, we demonstrate that our methodology
  has several novel accomplishments, including: (a) identifying distinct user behavioral
  segments based on the user content consumption patterns; (b) identifying impactful
  demographics groupings; and (c) creating rich persona descriptions by automatically
  adding pertinent attributes, such as names, photos, and personal characteristics.
  We validate our approach by implementing the methodology into an actual working
  system; we then evaluate it via quantitative methods by examining the accuracy of
  predicting content preference of personas, the stability of the personas over time,
  and the generalizability of the method via applying to two other datasets. Research
  findings show the approach can develop rich personas representing the behavior and
  demographics of real audiences using privacy-preserving aggregated online social
  media data from major online platforms. Results have implications for media companies
  and other organizations distributing content via online platforms.'
