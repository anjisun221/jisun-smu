abstract: "In this research, we investigate if and how more photos than a single headshot\
  \ can heighten the level of information provided by persona profiles. We conduct\
  \ eye-tracking experiments and qualitative interviews with variations in the photos:\
  \ a single headshot, a headshot and images of the persona in different contexts,\
  \ and a headshot with pictures of different people representing key persona attributes.\
  \ The results show that more contextual photos significantly improve the information\
  \ end users derive from a persona profile; however, showing images of different\
  \ people creates confusion and lowers the informativeness. Moreover, we discover\
  \ that choice of pictures results in various interpretations of the persona that\
  \ are biased by the end users' experiences and preconceptions. The results imply\
  \ that persona creators should consider the design power of photos when creating\
  \ persona profiles."
