abstract: Microblogging platforms are Web 2.0 services that represent a suitable environment
  for studying how information is propagated in social networks and how users can
  become influential. In this work we analyse the impact of the network features and
  of the users' behaviour on the information diffusion. Our analysis highlights a
  strong relation between the level of visibility of a message in the flow of information
  seen by a user and the probability that the user further disseminates the message.
  In addition, we also highlight the existence of other latent factors that impact
  on the dissemination probability, correlated with the properties of the user that
  generated the message. Considering these results we define an information propagation
  model that generates information cascades (i.e. flows of messages propagated from
  user to user) whose statistical properties match empirical observations.
