abstract: In this work, we reveal the structure of global news coverage of disasters
  and its determinants by using a large-scale news coverage dataset collected by the
  GDELT (Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone) project that monitors news media
  in over 100 languages from the whole world. Significant variables in our hierarchical
  (mixed-effect) regression model, such as population, political stability, damage,
  and more, are well aligned with a series of previous research. However, we find
  strong regionalism in news geography, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive
  datasets for the study of global news coverage.
