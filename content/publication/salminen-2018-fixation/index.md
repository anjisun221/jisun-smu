abstract: To more effectively convey relevant information to end users of persona
  profiles, we conducted a user study consisting of 29 participants engaging with
  three persona layout treatments. We were interested in confusion engendered by the
  treatments on the participants, and conducted a within-subjects study in the actual
  work environment, using eye-tracking and talk-aloud data collection. We coded the
  verbal data into classes of informativeness and confusion and correlated it with
  fixations and durations on the Areas of Interests recorded by the eye-tracking device.
  We used various analysis techniques, including Mann-Whitney, regression, and Levenshtein
  distance, to investigate how confused users differed from non-confused users, what
  information of the personas caused confusion, and what were the predictors of confusion
  of end users of personas. We consolidate our various findings into a confusion ratio
  measure, which highlights in a succinct manner the most confusing elements of the
  personas. Findings show that inconsistencies among the informational elements of
  the persona generate the most confusion, especially with the elements of images
  and social media quotes. The research has implications for the design of personas
  and related information products, such as user profiling and customer segmentation.
