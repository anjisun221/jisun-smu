abstract: The widespread adoption and dissemination of online news through social
  media systems have been revolutionizing many segments of our society and ultimately
  our daily lives. In these systems, users can play a central role as they share content
  to their friends. Despite that, little is known about news spreaders in social media.
  In this paper, we provide the first of its kind in-depth characterization of news
  spreaders in social media. In particular, we investigate their demographics, what
  kind of content they share, and the audience they reach. Among our main findings,
  we show that males and white users tend to be more active in terms of sharing news,
  biasing the news audience to the interests of these demographic groups. Our results
  also quantify differences in interests of news sharing across demographics, which
  has implications for personalized news digests.
