abstract: The objective of this study is to assess the longitudinal trends of media
  similarity and dissimilarity on the international scale. As news value has well-established
  political, cultural, and economic consequences, the degree to which media coverage
  and content is converging across countries has implications for international relations.
  To study this convergence, we use the daily data of the 100 topics that were over-reported
  in each country, compared to other countries, from March 7 to October 9, 2016. The
  results of this analysis indicate that two complementary patterns--globalization
  and domestication--explain the media attention across the countries. We conclude
  that this attention can be driven not only by geographical closeness but also by
  more complex dimensions, such as historical relationships. Also, although a group
  of countries often have common media attention, their similarity level depends on
  time and topic.
