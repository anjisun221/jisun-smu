abstract: 'Traditional media outlets are known to report political news in a biased
  way, potentially affecting the political beliefs of the audience and even altering
  their voting behaviors. Therefore, tracking bias in everyday news and building a
  platform where people can receive balanced news information is important. We propose
  a model that maps the news media sources along a dimensional dichotomous political
  spectrum using the co-subscriptions relationships inferred by Twitter links. By
  analyzing 7 million follow links, we show that the political dichotomy naturally
  arises on Twitter when we only consider direct media subscription. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate a real-time Twitter-based application that visualizes an ideological
  map of various media sources. '
