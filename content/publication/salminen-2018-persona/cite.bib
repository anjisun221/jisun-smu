 abstract = {Personas are widely used in software development, system design, and HCI studies. Yet, their evaluation is difficult, and there are no recognized and validated measurement scales to date. To improve this condition, this research develops a persona perception scale based on reviewing relevant literature. We validate the scale through a pilot study with 19 participants, each evaluating three personas (57 evaluations in total). This is the first reported effort to systematically develop and validate an instrument for persona perception measurement. We find the constructs and items of the scale perform well, with factor loadings ranging between 0.60 and 0.95. Reliability, measured as Cronbach's Alpha, is also satisfactory, encouraging us to pursue the use of the scale with a larger sample in future work.},
