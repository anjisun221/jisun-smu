abstract: Personas are widely used in software development, system design, and HCI
  studies. Yet, their evaluation is difficult, and there are no recognized and validated
  measurement scales to date. To improve this condition, this research develops a
  persona perception scale based on reviewing relevant literature. We validate the
  scale through a pilot study with 19 participants, each evaluating three personas
  (57 evaluations in total). This is the first reported effort to systematically develop
  and validate an instrument for persona perception measurement. We find the constructs
  and items of the scale perform well, with factor loadings ranging between 0.60 and
  0.95. Reliability, measured as Cronbach's Alpha, is also satisfactory, encouraging
  us to pursue the use of the scale with a larger sample in future work.
