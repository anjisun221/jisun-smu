abstract: The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people crave like-minded
  information and eschew information that conflicts with their beliefs, and that has
  negative consequences on political life. Yet, despite decades of research, this
  hypothesis remains theoretically promising but empirically difficult to test. We
  look into news articles shared on Facebook and examine whether selective exposure
  exists or not in social media. We find a concrete evidence for a tendency that users
  predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid conflicting ones, and partisans
  are more likely to do that. Building tools to counter partisanship on social media
  would require the ability to identify partisan users first. We will show that those
  users cannot be distinguished from the average user as the two subgroups do not
  show any demographic difference.
