abstract: We evaluate the effects of the topics of social media posts on audiences
  across five social media platforms (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube,
  and Reddit) at four levels of user engagement. We collected 3,163,373 social posts
  from 53 news organizations across five platforms during an 8month period. We analyzed
  the differences in news organization platform strategies by focusing on topic variations
  by organization and the corresponding effect on user engagement at four levels.
  Findings show that topic distribution varies by platform, although there are some
  topics that are popular across most platforms. User engagement levels vary both
  by topics and platforms. Finally, we show that one can predict if an article will
  be publicly shared to another platform by individuals with precision of approximately
  80%. This research has implications for news organizations desiring to increase
  and to prioritize types of user engagement.
