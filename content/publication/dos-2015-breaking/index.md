abstract: A growing number of people are changing the way they consume news, replacing
  the traditional physical newspapers and magazines by their virtual online versions
  or/and weblogs. The interactivity and immediacy present in online news are changing
  the way news are being produced and exposed by media corporations. News websites
  have to create effective strategies to catch people’s attention and attract their
  clicks. In this paper we investigate possible strategies used by online news corporations
  in the design of their news headlines. We analyze the content of 69,907 headlines
  produced by four major global media corporations during a minimum of eight consecutive
  months in 2014. In order to discover strategies that could be used to attract clicks,
  we extracted features from the text of the news headlines related to the sentiment
  polarity of the headline. We discovered that the sentiment of the headline is strongly
  related to the popularity of the news and also with the dynamics of the posted comments
  on that particular news.
