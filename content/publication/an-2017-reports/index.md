abstract: 'The Workshop Program of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial
  Intelligence’s International Conference on Web and Social Media (AAAI-17) was held
  in Montréal, Québec, Canada on Tuesday, May 15, 2017. There were eight workshops
  in the program: Digital Misinformation, Events Analytics Using Social Media Data,
  News and Public Opinion, Observational Studies through Social Media, Perceptual
  Biases and Social Media, Social Media and Demographic Research, Studying User Perceptions
  and Experiences with Algorithms, The ICWSM Science Slam. Workshops were held on
  the first day of the conference. Workshop participants met and discussed issues
  with a selected focus — providing an informal setting for active exchange among
  researchers, developers, and users on topics of current interest. Organizers from
  two of the workshop chose to include papers in the AAAI Technical Reports series
  (Observational Studies through Social Media and News and Public Opinion). Their
  papers were included as a nonarchival part of the ICWSM proceedings. Organizers
  from four of the workshops (Digital Misinformation, News and Public Opinion, Perceptual
  Biases and Social Media, and Studying User Perceptions and Experiences with Algorithms)
  submitted reports, which are reproduced in this report. Brief summaries of the other
  four workshops have been reproduced from their website descriptions.'
