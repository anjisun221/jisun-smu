abstract: 'The hypothesis of selective exposure assumes that people seek out information
  that supports their views and eschew information that conflicts with their beliefs,
  and that has negative consequences on our society. Few researchers have recently
  found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media: users are exposed
  to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what happens after exposure,
  particularly how individuals react to such exposure, though. Users might well be
  exposed to diverse articles but share only the partisan ones. To test this, we study
  partisan sharing on Facebook: the tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded
  news articles and avoid conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That
  is, whether partisan sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g.,
  depending on their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections);
  and 4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong
  evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the real
  world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political program,
  resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70 individuals. Based on
  what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan sharing has negative consequences:
  distorted perception of reality. However, we do also find positive aspects of partisan
  sharing: it is associated with people who are more knowledgeable about politics
  and engage more with it as they are more likely to vote in the general elections.'
