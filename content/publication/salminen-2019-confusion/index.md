abstract: We investigate whether additional photos beyond a single headshot makes
  a persona profile more informative without confusing the end user. We conduct an
  eye-tracking experiment and qualitative interviews with digital content creators
  after varying the persona in photos via a single headshot, a headshot and photo
  of the persona in different contexts, and a headshot with photos of different people
  with key persona attributes the gender and age. Findings show that contextual photos
  provide significantly more persona information to end users; however, showing photos
  of multiple people engenders confusion and lowers informativeness. Also, as anticipated,
  viewing additional photos requires more cognitive focus, which is measured by eye-tracking
  metrics; these metrics are correlated with levels of informativeness and confusion.
  Furthermore, various interpretations of the persona based on the choice of photos
  are biased by the end usersâ€™ experiences and preconceptions. Concerning persona
  design, findings indicate that persona creators need to consider the intended persona
  use objectives when selecting photos and when producing persona profiles. Using
  contextual photos can improve informativeness, but this demands more cognitive focus
  from end users. Thus, adding contextual photos increases the perceived informativeness
  of the persona profile without being obfuscating, but multiple photos of different
  people do evoke confusion about the targeted persona.
