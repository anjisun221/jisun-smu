abstract: Predicting user confusion can help improve information presentation on websites,
  mobile apps, and virtual reality interfaces. One promising information source for
  such prediction is eye-tracking data about gaze movements on the screen. Coupled
  with think-aloud records, we explore if user's confusion is correlated with primarily
  fixation-level features. We find that random forest achieves an accuracy of more
  than 70% when prediction user confusion using only fixation features. In addition,
  adding user-level features (age and gender) improves the accuracy to more than 90%.
  We also find that balancing the classes before training improves performance. We
  test two balancing algorithms, Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE)
  and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) finding that SMOTE provides a higher performance
  increase. Overall, this research contains implications for researchers interested
  in inferring users' cognitive states from eye-tracking data.
