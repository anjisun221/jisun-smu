abstract: " Contemporary media systems are in transition. The constellation of organizations,\
  \ groups, and individuals contributing information to national and international\
  \ news flows has changed as a result of the digital transformation. The 'hybrid\
  \ media system' has proven to be one of the most instructive concepts addressing\
  \ this change. Its focus on the mutually dependent interconnections between various\
  \ types of media organizations, actors, and publics has inspired prolific research.\
  \ Yet the concept can tempt researchers to sidestep systematic analyses of information\
  \ flows and actors’ differing degrees of influence by treating media systems as\
  \ a black box. To enable large-scale, empirical comparative studies aimed at identifying\
  \ interdependencies and power relationships in contemporary media systems, we propose\
  \ the concept of discursive power. This describes the ability of contributors to\
  \ communication spaces to introduce, amplify, and maintain topics, frames, and speakers,\
  \ thus shaping public discourses and controversies that unfold in interconnected\
  \ communication spaces. We also provide a theoretical framework of how structural\
  \ features of organizations and media systems contribute to the emergence of discursive\
  \ power for different types of actors in various contexts. This adds to the theoretical\
  \ toolkit available to researchers interested in the empirical analysis of contemporary\
  \ media systems. "
