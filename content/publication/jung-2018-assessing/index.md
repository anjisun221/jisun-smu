abstract: In this research, we evaluate four widely used face detection tools, which
  are Face++, IBM Bluemix Visual Recognition, AWS Rekognition, and Microsoft Azure
  Face API, using multiple datasets to determine their accuracy in inferring user
  attributes, including gender, race, and age. Results show that the tools are generally
  proficient at determining gender, with accuracy rates greater than 90%, except for
  IBM Bluemix. Concerning race, only one of the four tools provides this capability,
  Face++, with an accuracy rate of greater than 90%, although the evaluation was performed
  on a high-quality dataset. Inferring age appears to be a challenging problem, as
  all four tools performed poorly. The findings of our quantitative evaluation are
  helpful for future computational social science research using these tools, as their
  accuracy needs to be taken into account when applied to classifying individuals
  on social media and other contexts. Triangulation and manual verification are suggested
  for researchers employing these tools.
