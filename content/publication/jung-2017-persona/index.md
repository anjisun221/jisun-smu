abstract: We develop a methodology for persona generation using real time social media
  data for the distribution of products via online platforms. From a large social
  media account containing more than 30 million interactions from users from 181 countries
  engaging with more than 4,200 digital products produced by a global media corporation,
  we demonstrate that our methodology can first identify both distinct and impactful
  user segments and then create persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent
  features, such as names, photos, and personal attributes. We validate our approach
  by implementing the methodology into an actual working system that leverages large
  scale online user data for generation of persona descriptions. We present the overall
  methodological approach, data analysis process, and system development. Findings
  show this method can develop believable personas representing real groups of people
  using real-time online user data. Results have implications for those distributing
  products via online platforms.
