abstract: The process of content creation for distribution via social media platforms
  is not a trivial one for social media editors as the goal of creating both serious
  and engaging content is challenging, with no clear or differing guidelines or rules
  across and between platforms. For creators of serious content, such as news organizations,
  advertisers, or educational institutions, engagement has a deeper meaning beyond
  likes, shares, etc. that is aimed at the audience actually processing the underlying
  content associated with a social media post. In this research, we report findings
  from a group study that aimed to understand the process and challenges of creating
  engaging content across three social media platforms in a major news organization.
  The findings from the study indicate that creating engaging content is effort- and
  time-consuming, and they highlight the need to support the process of creating engaging
  content across multiple social media platforms. Our longer-term goal is to develop
  a system design to support social media editors' creation of engaging content with
  which they can select engaging passages from news articles and select platforms
  on which to publish the content.
