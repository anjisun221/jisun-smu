abstract: We report findings and implications from a semi-naturalistic user study
  of a system for Automatic Persona Generation (APG) using large-scale audience data
  of an organization's social media channels conducted at the workplace of a major
  international corporation. Thirteen participants from a range of positions within
  the company engaged with the system in a use case scenario. We employed a variety
  of data collection methods, including mouse tracking and survey data, analyzing
  the data with a mixed method approach. Results show that having an interactive system
  may aid in keeping personas at the forefront while making customer-centric decisions
  and indicate that data-driven personas fulfill information needs of decision makers
  by mixing personas and numerical data. The findings have implications for the design
  of persona systems and the use of online analytics data to better understand users
  and customers.
