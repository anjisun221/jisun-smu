abstract: A social-based routing protocol for opportunistic networks considers the
  direct delivery as forwarding metrics. By ignoring the indirect delivery through
  intermediate nodes, it misses chances to find paths that are better in terms of
  delivery ratio and time. To overcome this limitation, we propose to incorporate
  transitivity, which considers the indirect delivery through intermediate nodes,
  as one of the forwarding metrics. We also found that some message forwards do not
  improve the delivery performance. To reduce the number of these useless forwards,
  the proposed scheme forwards messages to an encountered node when the increase of
  total utility value is greater than a threshold. Using a simulator with real world
  trace data sets, we compare the proposed scheme with the existing protocols, epidemic
  routing and SimBetTS. Compared with SimBetTS, the proposed scheme increases delivery
  ratio by 1.5 percent and decreases delay time by 2 percent while reducing overhead
  by 30 percent.
