 abstract = {With the advent of social media services, media outlets have started reaching audiences on social-networking sites. On Twitter, users actively follow a wide set of media sources, form interpersonal networks, and propagate interesting stories to their peers. These media subscription and interaction patterns, which had previously been hidden behind media corporations' databases, offer new opportunities to understand media supply and demand on a large scale. Through a map that connects 77 media outlets based on Twitter subscription patterns, we are able to answer a variety of questions: to what extent New York Times and the Wall Street Journal readers overlap? Are they competitors or potential collaborators? Are people who know each other more likely to subscribe to similar outlets?},
