abstract: "With the advent of social media services, media outlets have started reaching\
  \ audiences on social-networking sites. On Twitter, users actively follow a wide\
  \ set of media sources, form interpersonal networks, and propagate interesting stories\
  \ to their peers. These media subscription and interaction patterns, which had previously\
  \ been hidden behind media corporations' databases, offer new opportunities to understand\
  \ media supply and demand on a large scale. Through a map that connects 77 media\
  \ outlets based on Twitter subscription patterns, we are able to answer a variety\
  \ of questions: to what extent New York Times and the Wall Street Journal readers\
  \ overlap? Are they competitors or potential collaborators? Are people who know\
  \ each other more likely to subscribe to similar outlets?"
