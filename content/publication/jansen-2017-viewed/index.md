abstract: ABSTRACT The identification of meaningful audience segments, such as groups
  of users, consumers, readers, audience, etc., has important applicability in a variety
  of domains, including for content publishing. In this research, we seek to develop
  a technique for determining both information dissemination and information discrimination
  of online content in order to isolate audience segments. The benefits of the technique
  include identification of the most impactful content for analysis. With 4,320 online
  videos from a major news organization, a set of audience attributes, and more than
  58 million interactions from hundreds of thousands of users, we isolate the key
  pieces of content in terms of identifying audience segments that are both (a) least
  and most discriminating in terms of audience segments and (b) the least and most
  impactful. By empirical methods, we show that 25.3 percent of the videos are so
  widely disseminated (i.e., viewed by so many different segments) that they are non-discriminatory,
  while 29.7 percent of the videos are very discriminatory (i.e., can clearly identify
  one or more audience segments) but their impact is marginal, as the user base is
  small. Implications are that there are critical values that can be identified to
  isolate the set of both distinct and impactful content in a given data set of online
  content. We demonstrate the utility of this line of analysis by using the approach
  to identify critical cut-off values for dynamic persona generation.
