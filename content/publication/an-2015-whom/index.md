abstract: "Given the ever increasing amount of publicly available social media data,\
  \ there is growing interest in using online data to study and quantify phenomena\
  \ in the offline 'real' world. As social media data can be obtained in near real-time\
  \ and at low cost, it is often used for 'now-casting' indices such as levels of\
  \ flu activity or unemployment. The term 'social sensing' is often used in this\
  \ context to describe the idea that users act as 'sensors', publicly reporting their\
  \ health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time period is then typically\
  \ aggregated in a 'one tweet, one vote' fashion by simply counting. At the same\
  \ time, researchers readily admit that social media users are not a perfect representation\
  \ of the actual population. Additionally, users differ in the amount of details\
  \ of their personal lives that they reveal. Intuitively, it should be possible to\
  \ improve now-casting by assigning different weights to different user groups. In\
  \ this paper, we ask 'How does social sensing actually work?' or, more precisely,\
  \ 'Whom should we sense-and whom not-for optimal results?'. We investigate how different\
  \ sampling strategies affect the performance of now-casting of two common offline\
  \ indices: flu activity and unemployment rate. We show that now-casting can be improved\
  \ by (1) applying user filtering techniques and (2) selecting users with complete\
  \ profiles. We also find that, using the right type of user groups, now-casting\
  \ performance does not degrade, even when drastically reducing the size of the dataset.\
  \ More fundamentally, we describe which type of users contribute most to the accuracy\
  \ by asking if 'babblers are better'. We conclude the paper by providing guidance\
  \ on how to select better user groups for more accurate now-casting."
