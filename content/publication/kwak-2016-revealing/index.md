abstract: In this work, we analyze more than two million news photos published in
  January 2016.  We demonstrate i) which objects appear the most in news photos; ii)
  what the sentiments of news photos are; iii) whether the sentiment of news photos
  is aligned with the tone of the text; iv) how gender is treated; and v) how differently
  political candidates are portrayed. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale
  study of news photo contents using deep learning-based vision APIs.
