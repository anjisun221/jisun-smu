abstract: We investigate the alignment of international attention of news media organizations
  within 193 countries with the expressed international interests of the public within
  those same countries from March 7, 2016 to April 14, 2017. We collect fourteen months
  of longitudinal data of online news from Unfiltered News and web search volume data
  from Google Trends and build a multiplex network of media attention and public attention
  in order to study its structural and dynamic properties. Structurally, the media
  attention and the public attention are both similar and different depending on the
  resolution of the analysis. For example, we find that 63.2% of the country-specific
  media and the public pay attention to different countries, but local attention flow
  patterns, which are measured by network motifs, are very similar. We also show that
  there are strong regional similarities with both media and public attention that
  is only disrupted by significantly major worldwide incidents (e.g., Brexit). Using
  Granger causality, we show that there are a substantial number of countries where
  media attention and public attention are dissimilar by topical interest. Our findings
  show that the media and public attention toward specific countries are often at
  odds, indicating that the public within these countries may be ignoring their country-specific
  news outlets and seeking other online sources to address their media needs and desires.
