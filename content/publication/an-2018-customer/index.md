abstract: We propose a novel approach for isolating customer segments using online
  customer data for products that are distributed via online social media platforms.
  We use non-negative matrix factorization to first identify behavioral customer segments
  and then to identify demographic customer segments. We employ a methodology for
  linking the two segments to present integrated and holistic customer segments, also
  known as personas. Behavioral segments are generated from customer interactions
  with online content. Demographic segments are generated using the gender, age, and
  location of these customers. In addition to evaluating our approach, we demonstrate
  its practicality via a system leveraging these customer segments to automatically
  generate personas, which are fictional but accurate representations of each integrated
  behavioral and demographic segment. Results show that this approach can accurately
  identify both behavioral and demographical customer segments using actual online
  customer data from which we can generate personas representing real groups of people.
