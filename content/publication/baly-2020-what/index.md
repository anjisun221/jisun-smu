abstract: Predicting the political bias and the factuality of reporting of entire
  news outlets are critical elements of media profiling, which is an understudied
  but an increasingly important research direction. The present level of proliferation
  of fake, biased, and propagandistic content online has made it impossible to fact-check
  every single suspicious claim, either manually or automatically. Thus, it has been
  proposed to profile entire news outlets and to look for those that are likely to
  publish fake or biased content. This makes it possible to detect likely fake news
  the moment they are published, by simply checking the reliability of their source.
  From a practical perspective, political bias and factuality of reporting have a
  linguistic aspect but also a social context. Here, we study the impact of both,
  namely (i) what was written (i.e., what was published by the target medium, and
  how it describes itself in Twitter) vs. (ii) who reads it (i.e., analyzing the target
  medium′s audience on social media). We further study (iii) what was written about
  the target medium (in Wikipedia). The evaluation results show that what was written
  matters most, and we further show that putting all information sources together
  yields huge improvements over the current state-of-the-art.
