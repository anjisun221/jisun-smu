abstract: Fact checking has been hard enough to do in traditional settings, but, as
  news consumption is moving on the Internet and sources multiply, it is almost unmanageable.
  To solve this problem, researchers have created applications that expose people
  to diverse opinions and, as a result, expose them to balanced information. The wisdom
  of this solution is, however, placed in doubt by this paper. Survey responses of
  60 individuals in the UK and South Korea and in-depth structured interviews of 10
  respondents suggest that exposure to diverse opinions would not always work. That
  is partly because not all individuals equally value opinion diversity, and mainly
  because the same individual benefits from it only at times. We find that whether
  one looks for diverse opinions largely depends on three factors--one's prior convictions,
  emotional state, and social context.
