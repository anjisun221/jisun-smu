abstract: Published by Reporters Without Borders every year, the Press Freedom Index
  (PFI) reflects the fear and tension in the newsroom pushed by the government and
  private sectors. While the PFI is invaluable in monitoring media environments worldwide,
  the current survey-based method has inherent limitations to updates in terms of
  cost and time. In this work, we introduce an alternative way to measure the level
  of press freedom using media attention diversity compiled from Unfiltered News.
