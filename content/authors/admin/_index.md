**Jisun An** is an Assistant Professor at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington (IUB). She is interested in doing data science in the area of journalism, politics, health, and computational social science. The research she does is highly interdisciplinary, which only can be achieved by combining theoretical foundations, computational methods such as NLP and machine learning, and massive computing capability. 

Previously, she was an Assistant Professor at the School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University. Before SMU, she worked at Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU as a scientist. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, UK in 2015. For her study, she was funded by EPSRC and she is now an honorable recipient of Google European Scholarship. She is an Associate Editor or EPJ Data Science Journal. She has been a member of the PC of major computer science conferences and computational social science conferences, including ICWSM, TheWeb, ACL, EMNLP, WSDM, AAAI, and IC2S2. She also has been organizing a workshop on News and Public Opinion (NECO) 2016-18, 20.
