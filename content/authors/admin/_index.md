**Jisun An** is an assistant professor at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SMU-SCIS). She is interested in doing data science in the area of journalism, politics, health, and computational social science. The research she does is highly interdisciplinary, which only can be achieved by combining theoretical foundations, computational methods such as NLP and machine learning, and massive computing capability. 

Before joining SMU-SIS, she worked at Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU as a scientist. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, UK in 2015. For her study, she was funded by EPSRC and she is now an honorable recipient of Google European Scholarship. She has been a member of the PC of major computer science conferences and computational social science conferences, including ICWSM 2012-21, WWW 2016-21, ACL 2020-21, EMNLP 2020-21, SocInfo 2014-17/20, IC2S2 2016-21. She also has been organizing a workshop on News and Public Opinion (NECO) 2016-18, 20.
